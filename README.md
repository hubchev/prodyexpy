# Calculation of factor intensity and sophistication indicators such as the PRODY and EXPY index by Hausmann et al. (2007).

This repo contains the two Stata commands prody and expy. Both commands are available on the SSC server and can be installed in Stata with

```{stata}
ssc install prody
ssc install expy
```
